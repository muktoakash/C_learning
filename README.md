# C_learning

This repository contains programs that I wrote in C.

To separate out the files, I am using different branches. More details below.

## Branching: Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced
- beginner branch contains any C code that I would consider a beginner should be able to work through. The topics would include simple data types, arrays, and simple functions, as well as scanf and printf.
- intermediate branch covers topics such as pointers, structs, header files and implementation files, along with simple algorithms and strings
- advanced branch covers abstract data types: stacks, queues, linked-lists, etc., dynamic memory management, and complicated algorithms like various sorting techniques, tree implementations.
